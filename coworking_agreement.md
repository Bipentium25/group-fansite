## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

# Priscilla
(I personally like when we can work togheter at the same time (live), but since this is a bigger group and I think it would be fine to work separately and then discuss about our approaches.)

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

# Nadia: 
I like to take a few minutes to think through a problem before discussing.

# Priscilla 
 I learn by doing, but I agree with Nadia I also like to read through the problem and think about it before sharing my thoughts. I also like to hear other people's understanding of the problem.
