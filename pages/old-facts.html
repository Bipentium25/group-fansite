                <li class=facts-block><h3>First Animated Feature Oscar Winner 2002</h3>
                  <p>Shrek was the very first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, beating Monsters, Inc. and Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius.</p></li>
                <li class=facts-block><h3>Chris Farley Was the Original Shrek</h3>
                  <p>The late comedian Chris Farley recorded most of Shrek's lines before he passed away. Afterward, Mike Myers took over and decided to give Shrek his now-iconic Scottish accent.</p></li>
                <li class=facts-block><h3>'Shrek' Means 'Fright' in German and Yiddish</h3>
                  <p>The word Shrek comes from the German word 'Schreck' and it means "fear" or "terror."</p></li>
                <li class=facts-block><h3>All-Star Status</h3>
                  <p>The movie's opening song, “All Star” by Smash Mouth, became so tied to Shrek that it's now one of the most recognizable movie-song pairings in pop culture.</p></li>
                <li class=facts-block><h3>Shrek is almost 8 foot tall</h3>
                  <p>Shrek is about 7-8ft tall, which is taller than most humans, although the tallest man ever was recorded was 8ft 11'!</p></li>

                <li class=facts-block><h3>Myers Recorded All His Lines Twice</h3>
                <p>After finishing recording in a regular voice, Myers asked to redo every line in a Scottish accent. DreamWorks loved it so much they agreed.</p></li>
                <li class=facts-block><h3>The Animators Hid Easter Eggs Everywhere</h3>
                <p>You can spot nods to other DreamWorks projects — for instance, Lord Farquaad's castle looks suspiciously like Disneyland, a jab at rival Disney.</p></li>
                <li class=facts-block><h3>Shrek has a Hollywood Star</h3>
                <p>You might think its just real people who can get Hollywood stars, but fictional characters can have them too! Shrek was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010!</p></li>
                <li class=facts-block><h3>Mike Myers's love speech was real</h3>
                <p>At the end of the first movie, when Shrek tells Fiona he loves her, Mike Myers actually recorded the lines opposite his real life wife, in order to make them sound authentic. So when he says he loves her, he really means it! Aww, what a romantic!</p></li>
                <li class=facts-block><h3>Shrek was meant to look very different</h3>
                <p>Shrek's original design was much more monstrous and less human-like. The animators wanted to make him more relatable and endearing, which is why they gave him a softer, more rounded appearance.</p></li>
